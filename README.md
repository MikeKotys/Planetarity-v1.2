# Planetarity-v1.2
Made by Mykhaylo Kotys.

Task remarks:
- "Implement 3 types of rockets with different base stats (acceleration, weight, cooldown, etc.),
which are distributed randomly amongst planets" - feature reworked. Every rocket type is available
to every planet as this makes the game more challenging as well as gives the player more tools to
work with in every situation.

- "UI: main menu, HUD, planet HUD (HP bar, shooting cooldown)" planet "HP bar" was substituted
with numeric HP % text as it was deemed more appropriate given the game's setting.
